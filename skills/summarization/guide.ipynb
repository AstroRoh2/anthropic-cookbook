    "# Summarization with Claude\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing that involves condensing large amounts of text into shorter, more digestible formats while retaining key information. In today's information-rich world, the ability to quickly extract and synthesize essential points from lengthy documents is invaluable across various industries and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on leveraging Claude's capabilities for summarization, with a particular emphasis on legal documents. Legal documents can often be long and tedious to read â€“ particularly where there is a lot of fine print and legal terminology. We'll explore techniques for effective summarization of such documents, methods for evaluating summary quality, and strategies for systematically improving summarization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects we'll cover include:\n",
    "- Crafting effective prompts for summarization\n",
    "- Extracting specific metadata from documents\n",
    "- Handling longer documents beyond typical token limits\n",
    "- Evaluating summary quality using automated methods (e.g., ROUGE scores and [Promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/) custom methods)\n",
    "- Iteratively improving summarization performance\n",
    "- General conclusive tips on how to optimize your summarization workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement and refine summarization tasks using Claude, along with a framework for applying these techniques to your own specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get going, it's worth talking about evaluations in this guide. Evaluating the quality of summarization is a notoriously challenging task. Unlike many other natural language processing tasks, summarization evaluation often lacks clear-cut, objective metrics. The process can be highly subjective, with different readers valuing different aspects of a summary. Traditional empirical methods like ROUGE scores, while useful, have limitations in capturing nuanced aspects such as coherence, factual accuracy, and relevance. Moreover, the \"best\" summary can vary depending on the specific use case, target audience, and desired level of detail. Despite these challenges, we explore several different approaches in this guide that can be leveraged, combining automated metrics, regular expressions, and task-specific criteria. In this guide we recognize that the most effective approach often involves a tailored combination of techniques suited to the particular summarization task at hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary Indexed Documents is an advanced approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that operates at the document level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method offers several advantages over traditional RAG techniques, particularly in scenarios involving large documents or when precise information retrieval is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document Summarization: Generate concise summaries for each document in your corpus (subset of text is queried and quickly summarized).\n",
    "2. Context Window Optimization: Ensure all summaries fit within the context window of your language model.\n",
    "3. Relevancy Scoring: Ask a model to rank the relevance of each summary to the query being asked.\n",
    "4. Reranking (Optional): Apply reranking techniques to further refine and compress the top-K results.\n",
    "5. Answer the query at-hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some distinct advantages to this approach: \n",
    "- More efficient way of ranking documents for retrieval, using less context than traditional RAG methods.\n",
    "- Superior Performance on Specific Tasks: Outperforms other RAG methods, consistently ranking the correct document first.\n",
    "- Optimized Information Retrieval: Reranking helps compress results, ensuring the most concise and relevant information is presented to the model."

    "In this guide, we've covered a range of techniques for summarizing documents with Claude, with a focus on legal documents. Building a perfect summarization system and eval framework for summarization is an art: it requires a combination of these methods in order to succeed. As we mentioned at the beginning, summarization is a very subjective topic, and yet we've had a good stab at finding feasible ways to evaluate it and feel comfortable with our results. Always remember too â€“ you aren't benchmarking your results against 100% accuracy. You're benchmarking against how well you could perform this complex task yourself; and with the speed and efficiency of Claude as demonstrated in this guide, you start to realise the true benefits to such a methodological approach, so you can spend time on the real decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping up the advice here, we've included some best practices to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Craft clear and specific prompts. Use things like \"don't preamble\" to constrain the output.\n",
    "2. Use at least 2 examples.\n",
    "3. Use guided summarization for domain-specific documents.\n",
    "4. Implement effective, advanced strategies for long documents.\n",
    "5. Regularly evaluate and refine your approach.\n",
    "6. Consider the ethical implications and limitations of AI-generated summaries."
